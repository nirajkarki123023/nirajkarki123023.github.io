            <p>
                Hello Guys, I am Niraj Jung Karki. I am an International Student from Nepal. I am currently majoring in Computer Science.
                I came to the United States in April 20 to attend sumer semester. I took CS 1030 class and it was so intresting and relatively easy. 
                There i learned HTML, JavaScript, CSS and python. I then took CS 1400 and there I learned python which was ok. I was not great at it but i 
                knew some basic things that was taught in CS 1030 which made it relatively easy. The thing that I had most fun learning was HTML, CSS. Python was altight 
                but JavaScript was the part that i was struggling.I knwe i was struggling at JavaScript during CS1030 final project which was to make a website about 
                random topic of my choice. There i was struggling only on JavaScript part. Hopefully this class will help me learn it.

            <h2> Upcoming JavaScript projects </h2> 
            <p>I am not currently sure and I am not good at JavaScript but am excited to learn and create many sick projects. Now i have learned about
                adding buttons and using js to make it interactive. I had learned in CS 1030 mainly in the final project but some how i managed to make it run with the 
                help of my friend and it was back in summer 2024. I fell like JS is still hard but slowly i'm getting the hang if it mainly because i have intrest in HTML, CSS but still 
                JS is hard for me till now.<br> I will update it as i will lern more about it. </p>
